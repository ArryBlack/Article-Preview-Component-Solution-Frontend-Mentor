## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt about structuring markup and making changes to CSS through javascript in response to user inputs.

### Continued development

The markup and CSS was messy and I had to use a lot of extra components which are probably not necessary. I'll make the necessary code changes based on any feedback.
There is also a 'bug', which occurs when testing the website's responsiveness with devtools, but shouldn't be an issue for the end user. Nonetheless, any help in fixing the bug is highly appreciated.
